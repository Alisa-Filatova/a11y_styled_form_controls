# Styled Accessible "Picker" Inputs
A repository of styled, accessible, native form elements that are typically super annoying to style.  


## Checkboxes
1. [Native Checkboxes](#src/native-checkbox)
2. [Tristate ARIA checkboxes](#src/aria-checkboxes)  


## Radio Buttons
Styled native radio button group patterns.  
1. [Native Radio Buttons](src/native-radio)  
2. [Rating Radios](src/native-radio--rating)  
3. [Radio Pill](src/native-radio--pill)  


## Range Slider
A styled native range slider that takes multiple browser quirks (re: varied implementations) into consideration.  
1. [Native Range Slider](src/native-range)  


## Switch Buttons  
Switches are a type of picker input that is typically represented as an on/off toggle control.  Unlike a checkbox, switches are meant to perform an instant change in a component or application's state.  
1. [Switch Button](src/switch--button/)
2. [Switch Checkbox](src/switch--checkbox/)
3. [ARIA Switch Component (different repo)](https://scottaohara.github.io/aria-switch-button/)


## Select Boxes
Styled native single and multi-select patterns.  
1. [Native Select Box](src/native-select)  
2. [Native Multi-Select Box](src/native-select--multi)  


## File Upload
A styled native file upload input that heavily relies upon the native input for appropriate announcements for assistive technologies.  
1. [Native File Upload](src/native-file)  


## Progress Bar
Considered part of the specification for form elements, yet not a focusable form control, progress bars indicate the current status on a scale of 0 to completion.
1. [Native Progress Bar](#src/native-progress)  
2. [ARIA Progress Bar](#src/aria-progress)
