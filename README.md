# Styled Accessible "Picker" Inputs

A repository of styled, accessible, native form elements that are typically super annoying to style.  

## Checkboxes
1. [Native Checkboxes](src/native-checkbox)
2. [Tristate ARIA checkboxes](#src/aria-checkboxes)  

## File Upload
A styled native file upload input that heavily relies upon the native input for appropriate announcements for assistive technologies.  
1. [Native File Upload](src/native-file)  

## Radio Buttons
A styleable native radio button group pattern.  
1. [Native Radio Buttons](src/native-radio)  
2. [Rating Radios](src/native-radio--rating)  
3. [Radio Pill](src/native-radio--pill)  

## Range Slider
A styled native range slider that takes multiple browser quirks (re: varied implementations) into consideration.  
1. [Native Range Slider](src/native-range)  

## Select Boxes
A styleable native single and multi-select pattern.  
1. [Native Select Box](#src/native-select)  
2. [Native Multi-Select Box](#src/native-select--multi)  

## Switch Buttons  
Switches are a type of picker input that is typically represented as an on/off toggle control.  Unlike a checkbox, switches are meant to perform an instance change in a component or application's state.  
1. [Switch Button](src/switch--checkbox/)
2. [Switch Checkbox](src/switch--button/)
3. [ARIA Switch Component (different repo)](https://scottaohara.github.io/aria-switch-button/)
