# Styled Accessible "Picker" Inputs

A repository of styled, accessible, checkboxes, radio buttons, selects, and more?  

## Checkboxes
1. Stylable native checkbox  
2. Tri-state ARIA checkboxes  

## Radio Buttons
A stylable native radio button group pattern.  
1. Basic design  
2. Rating design  

## Switch Buttons  
Switches are a type of picker input that is typically represented as an on/off toggle control.  Unlike a checkbox, switches are meant to perform an instance change in a component or application's state. 

Read more about switch buttons and check out the repository for an [ARIA switch component](https://github.com/scottaohara/aria-switch-button).
