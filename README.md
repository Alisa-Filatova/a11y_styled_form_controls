# Styled Accessible "Picker" Inputs
A repository of styled, accessible, native form elements that are typically super annoying to style.  


## Checkboxes and Radio Buttons
Styled native checkboxes, and radio button patterns.  
1. [Native Checkboxes](src/native-checkbox)
2. [Native Radio Buttons](src/native-radio)  
3. [Rating Radios](src/native-radio--rating)  
4. [Radio Pill](src/native-radio--pill)  


## Range Slider
A styled native range slider that takes multiple browser quirks (re: varied implementations) into consideration.  
1. [Native Range Slider (in progress)](src/native-range)  


## Switch Buttons  
Switches are a type of button control that is typically represented in the form of an on/off toggle UI control. Unlike a checkbox, switches are meant to perform an instant change in a component or application's state, but as there is no native "switch" control, checkboxes or button elements (with appropriate ARIA attributes) are often used as a base or substitute for this type of control.
1. [Switch Button](src/switch--button/)
2. [Switch Checkbox](src/switch--checkbox/)
3. [ARIA Switch Component (external repo)](https://scottaohara.github.io/aria-switch-button/)


## Select Boxes
Styled native single and multi-select patterns.  
1. [Native Select Box (in progress)](src/native-select)  
2. [Native Multi-Select Box (in progress)](src/native-select--multi)  


## File Upload
A styled native file upload input that heavily relies upon the native input for appropriate announcements for assistive technologies.  
1. [Native File Upload (in progress)](src/native-file)  


## Progress Bar
Considered part of the specification for form elements, yet not a focusable form control, progress bars indicate the current status on a scale of 0 to completion.
1. [Native Progress Bar (in progress)](src/native-progress)
